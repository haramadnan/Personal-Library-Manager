ðŸ›  Implementation Steps

1. Setup and Data Handling

Imported required modules (json for data storage and os to check file existence).

Defined a data_file (library.txt) to store books.


import json
import os

data_file = "library.txt"

Implemented load_library() to read data from the file and save_library() to store book data persistently.


def load_library():
    if os.path.exists(data_file):
        with open(data_file, "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    return []

def save_library(library):
    with open(data_file, "w") as file:
        json.dump(library, file)

2. Adding a Book

Function add_book(library) prompts the user to enter book details and appends them to the library.

Saves the updated list.


def add_book(library):
    title = input("Enter the title of the book: ")
    author = input("Enter the author of the book: ")
    year = input("Enter the year of the book: ")
    genre = input("Enter the genre of the book: ")
    read = input("Have you read the book? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"

    new_book = {
        'title': title,
        'author': author,
        'year': year,
        'genre': genre,
        'read': read,
    }

    library.append(new_book)
    save_library(library)
    print(f"Book '{title}' added successfully.")


---

3. Removing a Book

remove_book(library) checks if a book exists and removes it by filtering the list.

Saves updated data if the book is found.


def remove_book(library):
    title = input("Enter the title of the book to remove: ").lower()
    initial_length = len(library)
    library = [book for book in library if book['title'].lower() != title]
    
    if len(library) < initial_length:
        save_library(library)
        print(f"Book '{title}' removed successfully.")
    else:
        print(f"Book '{title}' not found in the library.")


---

4. Searching for a Book

search_library(library) allows users to search by title or author.

Displays all matching results.


def search_library(library):
    search_by = input("Search by title or author: ").lower()
    search_term = input(f"Enter the {search_by}: ").lower()

    results = [book for book in library if search_term in book[search_by].lower()]
    
    if results:
        for book in results:
            status = "Read" if book['read'] else "Unread"
            print(f"{book['title']} by {book['author']} - {book['year']} - {book['genre']} - {status}")
    else:
        print(f"No books found matching '{search_term}' in the {search_by} field.")


---

5. Displaying Books and Statistics

display_all_books(library): Lists all books with their details.

display_statistics(library): Calculates and displays reading progress.


def display_statistics(library):
    total_books = len(library)
    read_books = len([book for book in library if book['read']])
    percentage_read = (read_books / total_books) * 100 if total_books > 0 else 0

    print(f"Total books: {total_books}")
    print(f"Percentage read: {percentage_read:.2f}%")

6. Main Menu & User Interaction

main() provides an interactive menu.

Calls appropriate functions based on user input.


def main():
    library = load_library()
    while True:
        print("\nWelcome to Your Personal Library Manager!")
        print("1. Add a book")
        print("2. Remove a book")
        print("3. Search for a book")
        print("4. Display all books")
        print("5. Display statistics")
        print("6. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if choice == '1':
            add_book(library)
        elif choice == '2':
            remove_book(library)
        elif choice == '3':
            search_library(library)
        elif choice == '4':
            display_all_books(library)
        elif choice == '5':
            display_statistics(library)
        elif choice == '6':
            print("Exiting Personal Library Manager!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
